               <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
               <p>Employee attrition, or turnover, is a critical metric for organizations as it impacts productivity,
                    morale, and overall business performance. This report aims to analyze the factors contributing to
                    employee attrition and provide insights to help the company develop strategies to improve employee
                    retention.</p>

               <h2 id="data-collection">Data Collection</h2>
               <p>The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the 'greendestination.csv' file. It contains
                    various features related to employee demographics, job satisfaction, compensation, and other
                    relevant attributes.</p>

               <h2 id="eda">Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
               <p>EDA was conducted to understand the distribution of data, identify missing values, and explore
                    relationships between different features and attrition.</p>
               <h3>Key Findings:</h3>
               <ul>
                    <li><strong>Attrition Rate:</strong> The overall attrition rate is calculated and displayed, showing
                         the percentage of employees who left the company.</li>
                    <li><strong>Attrition due to Age:</strong> Younger employees tend to have higher attrition rates,
                         indicating that age is a significant factor in employee turnover.</li>
                    <li><strong>Years at Company vs. Attrition:</strong> Employees with fewer years at the company are
                         more likely to leave, suggesting that newer employees are at a higher risk of attrition.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance from Home vs. Attrition:</strong> Employees living farther from the workplace
                         tend to have higher attrition rates, highlighting the impact of commute distance on employee
                         retention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Job Satisfaction vs. Attrition:</strong> Lower job satisfaction is associated with
                         higher attrition rates, emphasizing the importance of job satisfaction in retaining employees.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly Income vs. Attrition:</strong> Employees with lower monthly incomes are more
                         likely to leave, indicating that compensation plays a crucial role in employee retention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Years with Current Manager vs. Attrition:</strong> Employees with fewer years with their
                         current manager tend to have higher attrition rates, suggesting that managerial relationships
                         influence employee turnover.</li>
                    <li><strong>Years Since Last Promotion vs. Attrition:</strong> Employees who have not been promoted
                         for a long time are more likely to leave, pointing to the importance of career advancement
                         opportunities in retaining employees.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gender vs. Attrition:</strong> The analysis shows the distribution of attrition across
                         different genders, providing insights into gender-specific attrition trends.</li>
               </ul>

               <h2 id="model-evaluation">Model Evaluation</h2>
               <p>Various machine learning models were evaluated to predict employee attrition. The best model was
                    identified based on its ROC AUC score, and the model was saved for future predictions.</p>
               <h3>Model Performance:</h3>
               <ul>
                    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
                    <li>Gradient Boosting</li>
                    <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
                    <li>Decision Tree Classifier</li>
                    <li>Naive Bayes</li>
                    <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
                    <li>Support Vector Machine</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The models were evaluated based on accuracy, ROC AUC score, confusion matrix, and classification
                    report. The best-performing model was identified and saved for future use.</p>

               <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
               <p>The analysis provides valuable insights into the factors contributing to employee attrition. Key

                    years with the current manager, and years since the last promotion play a significant role in
                    employee turnover. By addressing these factors, the company can develop targeted strategies to
                    improve employee retention and reduce attrition rates.</p>
